# Package Extensions

Custom models and metrics can be defined with the `MLModel` and `MLMetric` constructors for use with the model fitting, prediction, and performance assessment tools provided by the package.

```{r}
## Logistic regression model
LogisticModel <- MLModel(
  name = "LogisticModel",
  types = "binary",
  fit = function(formula, data, weights, ...) {
    glm(formula, data = data, weights = weights, family = binomial, ...)
  },
  predict = function(object, newdata, ...) {
    predict(object, newdata = newdata, type = "response")
  },
  varimp = function(object, ...) {
    pchisq(coef(object)^2 / diag(vcov(object)), 1)
  }
)

## F2 score metric
f2_score <- MLMetric(
  function(observed, predicted, ...) {
    f_score(observed, predicted, beta = 2, ...)
  },
  name = "f2_score",
  label = "F2 Score",
  maximize = TRUE
)

library(MASS)
res <- resample(type ~ ., data = Pima.tr, model = LogisticModel)
summary(performance(res, metric = f2_score))
```
