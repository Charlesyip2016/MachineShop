\description{
Resampling Classes and Methods

The base \code{MLControl} constructor initializes a set of parameters that
are common to all resampling methods.

\code{BootControl} constructs an \code{MLControl} object for simple bootstrap
resampling in which models are fit with bootstrap resampled training sets and
used to predict the full data set.

\code{CVControl} constructs an \code{MLControl} object for repeated K-fold
cross-validation.  In this procedure, the full data set is repeatedly
partitioned into K-folds.  Within a partitioning, prediction is performed on
each of the K folds with models fit on all remaining folds.

\code{OOBControl} constructs an \code{MLControl} object for out-of-bootstrap
resampling in which models are fit with bootstrap resampled training sets and
used to predict the unsampled cases.

\code{SplitControl} constructs an \code{MLControl} object for splitting data
into a seperate trianing and test set.

\code{TrainControl} constructs an \code{MLControl} object for training and
performance evaluation to be performed on the same training set.

Arguments \code{summary}, \code{cutoff}, and \code{cutoff_index} are
deprecated.  The latter two may be specified directly in calls to
